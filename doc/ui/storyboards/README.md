# UI Storyboards

Put storyboard + sequences in this folder.

## What goes here
- PNG/PDF exports that show screen-to-screen flows
- Transitions must be labeled (tap, scan, submit, etc.)
- Storyboards should reference user stories (US numbers) somewhere on the diagram

## Naming convention (recommended)
- `storyboard_<flow>_v<version>.png`
  - Example: `storyboard_join_waitlist_v1.png`

## How to make a storyboard (quick)
1. Duplicate mockup frames
2. Arrange them left-to-right (or top-to-bottom)
3. Add arrows between frames
4. Label arrows with actions
5. Add text labels like `US 01.01.01`
6. Export as PNG and save here
